## Getting Started
Refer to the installation guide in the [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/setup) to get the program set up.
Once this is sorted you can start to become familiar with the syntax of sketchybar by going through the default [*sketchybarrc*](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/blob/master/sketchybarrc) file,
which is located in `~/.config/sketchybar/sketchybarrc` and looks like this:

All commands and options are explained in detail in the relevant sections
of the configuration [documentation](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/bar). You can try the commands directly from
the commandline to see which affect they have and how they alter the bar. Once you have become familiar with the syntax you can
look for a config to start from [here](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/47) or start from scratch and customize
everything to your liking.

You might also enjoy looking at the [Tips & Tricks](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/config/tricks) section
for some further tips on your journey. If you are searching for functional items you might want to check the
[plugins](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/discussions/12) section if someone has already created what you are looking for.

Should you encounter things not working as you expect them to, please *do not* hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyBar/issues), as
this is either a bug or a documentation problem and relevant in any case.

## Credits
This project was forked from *[spacebar](https://github.com/cmacrae/spacebar)* and completely reimagined and rewritten. <br>
The original idea is based on the status bar that was included in *[yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai)* before getting removed.
